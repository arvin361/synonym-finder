# Features

## Existing Features

#### Dynamic Page

- The application is modeled as a progressive web application to render a single-page-app's functionality without full page reloads and optimized to perform like a native app.

- The application takes advantage of the `useEffect` functionality in which the user is able to search a word dynamically by updating the results upon each key stroke made.

- Since the application displays results "in real time" there was no use for a search bar/button making the design cleaner and simpler for the users experience.

#### Search / Results

- The application is written to return a list of Synonyms organized by each of its parts of speech.
- The application also displays a Definitions section in which it also gives the user a short definition for each of its parts of speech as well.
- The application also displays the current word searched below the search field as reference due to the following action.

- #### Actions:
  - Ability to clear the input field upon clicking the search bar for a more efficient user experience.
  - Ability to click on any given synonyms displayed and search the synonyms for that word as well by using its `/:id`.

#### Suggested words / Non-existent word

- The application is able to give a list of suggestions if the user searches for a word that doesn't exist.

- #### Actions:
  - Ability to display a list of **_Did you mean:_** words
  - Ability to click on any suggested word and display the synonyms and its other results for that word.

## Future Features To Implement

- A "show more" feature that displays more synonyms and results.
- Show a list of antonyms for a searched word.
- Implement a login and authentication feature.
- Implement a database and server.
- Ability to manage a users search history after their browser session.
